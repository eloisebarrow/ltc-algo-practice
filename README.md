```

### Problem 10

```

Each found entry will print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry is not found, print Not found instead.

Input 1: [{sam:99912222},{tom:11122222},{harry:12299933}]
Input 2: ['sam','ed','harry']

Output:
sam=99912222
NOT FOUND
harry:12299933
```

### Problem 11

```

Input: [3, 2, 5, 7, 11, 15], 9
Output: Return [2, 7]
```

### Problem 12

```
Write a function called hasVowels that takes in an array of words and returns a new array of only those words that contain one or more vowels.

Input: hasVowels(['jon', 'ada', 'ppzpp', 'brgggg', 'eric'])
Output: ['jon', 'ada', 'eric']
```

### Problem 13

```
Write a function called isPrime, that takes in a positive integer and returns
True if number is Prime, otherwise false

Input: isPrime(10)
Output: False

Input: isPrime(13)
Output: True
```


### Problem 14

```
Write a function called uniqueVals that will return an array of unique values, no duplicates allowed. It will accept 2 arguments, the first will be the desired length of the returned array and the second will the be the max value in the random set.

Input: uniqueVals(5,10)
Possible Output: [1,7,3,9,2]
```

### Problem 15

```
Write a function called greatestCommomFactor that, given two distinct positive integers,
returns the greatest common factor of those two values

Input: greatestCommonFactor(9,12)
Output: 3

Input: greatestCommonFactor(6,18)

Input: greatestCommonFactor(7,11)
Output: 1
```

### Problem 16

Input: stringCompress("abcd")
Output: "abcd"
```

### Problem 17

```
Given a list (or array) of integers, return a new list such that each element at index i of the new list 
is the product of all the numbers in the original list except the one at i.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]

Input: [3, 2, 1]

Added difficulty:
Answer cannot include division.
```

### Problem 18

```
Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of 
non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

Input: [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] 
Output: 13

Input: [5, 1, 1, 5] 
Output: 10

Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
```

### Problem 19

```
Given a list of integers, return a list of even integers, squared. 

Input: [8,1,9,10]
Output: [64,100]
```

### Problem 20

```
Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), 
and a digit string, return all possible letters the number 
could represent. You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit.


For example if: 
{2: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], 4: ["g", "h", "i"], 
5: ["j", "k", "l"], 6: ["m", "n", "o"]} 
then “23” should return 
[“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].
```

### Problem 21 (Arrays) https://www.techiedelight.com/find-pair-with-given-sum-array/
```
Find pair with given sum in the array:

Given an unsorted integer array, find a pair with a given sum in it.

Input:
 
arr = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]
sum = 10
 
Output:
 
Pair found at index 0 and 2 (8 + 2)
 
or
 
Pair found at index 1 and 4 (7 + 3)
```

### Problem 22 (Arrays) https://www.techiedelight.com/check-subarray-with-0-sum-exists-not/

```
Check if subarray with 0 sum exists or not

Given an integer array, check if it contains a subarray having zero-sum

Input:  { 3, 4, -7, 3, 1, 3, 1, -4, -2, -2 }
 
Output: Subarray with zero-sum exists
 
The subarrays with a sum of 0 are:
 
{ 3, 4, -7 }
{ 4, -7, 3 }
{ -7, 3, 1, 3 }
{ 3, 1, -4 }
{ 3, 1, 3, 1, -4, -2, -2 }
{ 3, 4, -7, 3, 1, 3, 1, -4, -2, -2 }

Note that the problem deals with subarrays that are contiguous i.e. whose elements occupy consecutive positions in the array.
